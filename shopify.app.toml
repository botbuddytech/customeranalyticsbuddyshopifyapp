# DEFAULT CONFIG FILE (Legacy/Default)
# 
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is the DEFAULT config file that Shopify CLI uses if no --config flag is specified.
# 
# For development, use: npm run dev (uses shopify.app.dev.toml)
# For production, use: npm run deploy (uses shopify.app.prod.toml)
# 
# This file currently points to PRODUCTION and has automatically_update_urls_on_dev = false,
# which means it's SAFE - even if someone runs "shopify app dev" without --config, 
# it won't overwrite production URLs.
#
# Learn more about configuring your app at https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/tools/cli/configuration
